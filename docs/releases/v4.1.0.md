# Wheel v4.1.0 (internal)

## Overview
- Internal milestone to mark the adapter + state-store foundation as shipped.
- Telemetry hooks centralized; debug logging noise reduced. No external distribution planned until v4.9.

## Highlights
- Added `safeEmit` helper to wrap `onEvent` telemetry callbacks safely.
- Routed navigation volume load/switch events through the telemetry helper to avoid runtime errors.
- Gated focus-ring debug logging and chain summaries behind the debug flag to keep console output clean.

## Testing
- `npm test` (node --test): pass (37/37).

## Artifacts
- Tag: `v4.1.0` (internal)
- Branch: `master`
