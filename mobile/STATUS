# Wheel - Universal Hierarchical Data Navigation System
## Development Status Report - Last Updated: November 7, 2025

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Wheel** is a revolutionary universal data navigation system with innovative 2D interface for hierarchical data. Mobile-first ES6 native module architecture transcends traditional scrolling limitations through arc-based "sprocket gear" navigation. Supports any data domain through JSON configuration - ready for deployment across e-commerce, medical equipment, government databases, and more.

### NAVIGATION PHILOSOPHY - REVOLUTIONARY 2D DESIGN
**Superior to Traditional Scrolling:**
Traditional interfaces limit users to 1-dimensional interaction (vertical scrolling). This system implements true 2-dimensional navigation:

**Portrait Mode - Dual-Axis Navigation:**
- **Focus Ring (Arc)**: Traverses infinite lists rotationally (CW/CCW) - items at any configured hierarchy level
- **Parent Button**: Migrates nodes OUT from Focus Ring through finite hierarchical layers (radially outward from rotation center)  
- **Child Pyramid**: Migrates nodes IN to Focus Ring through finite hierarchical layers (radially inward toward rotation center)

**Landscape Mode - Digital Table of Contents:**
- **Focus Ring**: Traverses finite hierarchical layers through all configured levels
- **Upper Right Display**: Shows description of current layer node under magnifier
- **Simplified Navigation**: Single mechanism eliminates Parent/Child complexity

**The Focus Ring - Sprocket Gear Concept:**
The focus ring is NOT a circle or "hose reel" - it's an arc functioning as a sprocket gear. Data forms a sprocket chain extending linearly with defined start/end points. The gear rotates CW/CCW until first/last nodes reach the magnifier, then stops. This chain could theoretically be infinite, allowing rotational traversal of unlimited data sets while maintaining spatial orientation.

**Spatial Model & Terminology:**
For complete spatial definitions, coordinate systems, and positioning rules, see **[DESIGNSPEC.md](DESIGNSPEC.md)**

**Key Terminology (see DESIGNSPEC for full details):**
- **OUT Migration**: Nodes move OUT from Focus Ring to Parent Button (radially outward from rotation center)
- **IN Migration**: Nodes move IN from Child Pyramid to Focus Ring (radially inward toward rotation center)
- **Rotational Navigation**: CW/CCW movement within the Focus Ring sprocket system
- **Clock Positions**: 6 o'clock (180°), 9 o'clock (270°), 3 o'clock (90°), etc.
- **Off-Screen Zone**: 0° - 90° quadrant (12:00 → 3:00) - never position elements here

**Note**: Top-level items (e.g., regions, markets) are excluded from rotational traversal by design - users navigate TO these items but not THROUGH their lists rotationally.

## Virtual Level Logic & Orphan Adoption

The catalog implements a sophisticated virtual level system:

### Virtual vs Real Level Architecture
- **Real Levels**: Data exists in JSON structure at a specific hierarchy depth
- **Virtual Levels**: Computed groupings from child data (e.g., grouping items by property)
  Uses `is_virtual: true` flag with `virtual_grouping_property` and `virtual_membership_property`
- **Aggregated Levels**: Combine items across intermediate collections
  Uses `aggregates_across` configuration to specify intermediate level

### Orphan Adoption System
- Items with `in_a_group: false` (or similar membership flag) are considered orphans
- Virtual level creation adopts orphans into a configurable group (e.g., "Other")
- Provides consistent UX while respecting data structure differences

### Navigation Flow Impact
- Items with virtual groups: Parent → Virtual Group → Children (3 levels)
- Items without virtual groups: Parent → Children (2 levels, skips virtual)
- Mixed case: Real groups + Orphan group

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Virtual level detection with configuration-driven checking
- ✅ Orphan adoption into configurable group name
- ✅ Child Pyramid click handlers with virtual level logic
- ✅ Universal getItemsAtLevel() for all navigation
- ✅ Proper navigation flow through any hierarchy depth
- ✅ Configuration-driven irregular plurals

- **Location**: `mobile-renderer.js` → `updateFocusRingPositions()`
- **Current**: Algorithm centers middle item at magnifier angle
- **Required**: Offset calculation to place array[0] at 270° (9 o'clock), distribute remaining items clockwise
- **Impact**: Critical for sequential navigation UX (Bible books, alphabetical lists)
- **Reference**: See DESIGNSPEC.md Section 4.1 for positioning rules

**Priority 2: Multi-Volume System** *(95% complete)*
- ✅ Volume discovery and selector UI working
- ✅ Both volumes (MMdM + Gutenberg) load and navigate correctly
